0.1.1.BETA (September 14, 2016)
- Layout-Redesign
  the views of the ontology debugger are rearranged and icons and buttons are redesigned
  Note: Clients that used the ontology debugger v0.1.0.BETA have to call Windows->Reset selected tab to default state to make these changes visible.
- Redesign of lifecycle of debugging session (Start, Stop and Restart Session)
- Renaming of components (e.g. diagnoses are renamed to fauly axioms) make components more understandable
- Fix for usage of anonymous ontologies: the user is not anymore asked to store anonymous ontologies created by the debugger (see http://protege-project.136.n4.nabble.com/Protege-5-0-Debug-ontologies-td4666420.html). Now only running debugging sessions are creating and using these debugging ontologies which are then visible. When a session is stopped the debugging ontology is removed.
- The Ontology Debugger tab has been removed. The Debugger can be opened in Tools->Debug Ontology... or in Window->Tabs->Debugger
- other fixes
0.1.0.BETA (August 02, 2016)
