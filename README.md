The project implments in a number of algorithms for debugging of knowledge bases, 
which do not satisfy requirements and/or test cases specified by the user. 

The project can be applied to debugging of SAT (SAT4J), 
Constraints (Choco, JSolver) and OWL (any OWLAPI compatible reasoner) knowledge 
bases as well as normal logic programs under ASP semantics.

At the moment the project team focuses on development on the OWL 
debugging module, therefore, CP and SAT modules might be slightly outdated.
