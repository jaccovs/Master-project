enginetype = Diagnosis engines compute the sets of faulty axioms. HS-DAG and HS-Tree additionally compute the conflict sets.

numofleadingdiags = Calculate at most this number of sets of faulty axioms. The higher the number, the more expensive is the calculation.

testincoherencyinconsistency = The debugger can check for inconsistency and incoherency (class consistency) in an ontology.

extractModules = Extract Module Help Message

minimalQueries = Minimal Queries to calculate

maximalQueries = Maximal Queries to calculate

enrichquery = Enrich the query with entailed axioms (slightly more expensive).

rm = Requirments measures used during query computation. Possible measures are Entropy-based, Split in Half or Dynamic Risk.

sortcriterion = A sorting criterion used as comparator on insertion, sorting etc of formulas.

entropythreshold = Entropy threshold used in Entropy, Split in Half and Dynamic Risk. Range: [0 .. 0,5].

cardinalitythreshold = Cardinality threshold used in Dynamic Risk. The upper bound depends on the number of leading diagnoses.

cautiousparameter = Cautious Parameter used in Dynamic Risk. Lower bound is 0,01. The upper bound depends on the number of leading diagnoses.

costEstimator = Cost estimation used for diagnosis calculation (used in HS-DAG and HS-Tree).
