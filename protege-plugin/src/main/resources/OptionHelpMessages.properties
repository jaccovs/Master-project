enginetype = Engines to compute the leading diagnoses. HS-DAG and HS-Tree can compute conflict sets. InverseQuickXPlain is faster.

numofleadingdiags = Search for at most this number of diagnoses. The higher the number, the more expensive is the calculation.

testincoherencyinconsistency = This option also checks for incoherencies in your ontology.

extractModules = Extract Module Help Message

minimalQueries = Minimal Queries to calculate

maximalQueries = Maximal Queries to calculate

enrichquery = Enrich the query with entailed axioms.

rm = Requirments measures used during query computation. Possible measures are Entropy-based, Split in Half or Dynamic Risk.

sortcriterion = A sorting criterion used as comparator on insertion, sorting etc of formulas.

entropythreshold = Entropy threshold used in Entropy, Split in Half and Dynamic Risk. Range: [0 .. 0,5].

cardinalitythreshold = Cardinality threshold used in Dynamic Risk. The upper bound depends on the number of leading diagnoses.

cautiousparameter = Cautious Parameter used in Dynamic Risk. Lower bound is 0,01. The upper bound depends on the number of leading diagnoses.

costEstimator = Cost estimation used for diagnosis calculation (HS-DAG, HS-Tree).
